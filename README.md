<h1>What To Wear </h1>

What to Wear is a primarily React based application that allows users to determine what to wear based on the weather conditions for a given location. This project focuses on building the foundational front-end components and integrating initial weather data functionality.

The dynamic weather display was created by fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API as soon as the application loads, which allows the app to display the current temperature in Fahrenheit at the top of the screen. The temperature will be available in Celcius, as well, at a later date.

A collection of clothing was hard-coded in from a pre-defined array of data, providing useful suggestions that are, also, prefiltered based on the current weather temperature of the user's location.

The "Add garment" modal has been created so that users can add their own clothing options in the future. The clothing cards can, also, be selected to see a larger preview along with its title.
